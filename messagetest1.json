Sometimes they are just there without being really there for *you*.\n\nI think you're taking a lot of this advice as. \"They don't know, these people aren't in my life, they aren't me, they just don't see\". Instead, maybe an approach you can do is a reflect on yourself. \nIf I had told you,\n\"My friends have shitted on me\"\n \"I have been blocked\" \n\"They have left with no explanation\"\nWhat would you tell me as advice? It is probably close to what everyone is telling you here.\n\nIt sounds like these people are not your friends. Friends wouldn't do this. Family wouldn't do that either. \nHaving them be your friend is a high honor in my opinion. You should not let them take that for granted and step all over you.\nAlways know your worth and that you deserve people who make you happy. If they can't provide that, then maybe you need to do some thinking.\n\nJust remember, things can change [:\nMaybe they will turn around and forgiveness can be established. But until then, how do you want to feel? How do you want to be respected?",

This last year has been one of the roughest I've had and it was hard not reaching out to them. I knew, however, that I was a better person without them. I didn't like how I was around them.

You may fight with them but at the end of the day they wont ever talk bad about you. It's just part of growing older and wiser. You tend to keep a small number of friends like that and they are hard to find. You WILL find them though. Just wist and see. It's also important to realize that you shpuld.be happy being by yourself and in your own mind. You shouldn't let anyone else control the way you feel. If you still feel like giving out that gift, do it. Give it to them and leave. That truly shows how much better of a person you are. Alternatively, buy something for yourself. Theres nothing wrong with that. Buy some concert tickets/new clothes/a nice dinner/ something along those lines that makes you happy",

It's hard to know what the collection of symbols mean as a whole, if we dont know what the symbols themselves mean.\n\nWhen you look at ancient structures such as the Great Pyramid of Egypt.\n\nJust the amount of forethought, and design that went into it, is mind boggling.\nFor example,\n\nNot only is the Great Pyramid aligned with the cosmos, but\nIf you multiply the base dimensions, by the number 43,200 you get the number of the circumference of the earth!\nOutstanding!\n\nNow you may say, why the number 43,200?\nGood question.\n\nThe number 43,200 is what you get when you multiply 72, by 600.\n\n72 is the number of years it takes for the procession of the equinox to travel one degree in the heavens.\n\nI dont know about the number 600 yet, as I have just now started the audiobook by Dr. Hancock who explains these things.\n\nBut that alone is mind boggling that they knew the circumference of the earth.\n\nI do believe that there were indeed very smart civilizations before us that got wiped out by some cataclysmic event such as the younger dryas around 12,800 - 11,600 years ago.\n\nWho knows?\n\nI think there are so many things we've yet to uncover about the ancients.\n\u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u00af",

Again, there are some texts that cite this and get into specifics of what was brought down from the sky and taught to us. I believe the book of Enoch or some part of the Dead Sea scrolls mention this. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to search for it again.\n\nBut there are some positives in what was brought to us from it. \n\nI think that after the giants died off that someone or being  (who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usually depicted  with carrying a bag meaning knowledge) showed them the errors in how they lived......or my other theory that the schools that eventually taught this knowledge became corrupt and selfish and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pass down the keys to unlock hidden knowledge in symbolism so after thousands of generations everyone forgot.\n\nI think humans may have abused what was given to them or used it for evil vs for good. So the knowledge was taken away by a higher power. Yes I believe there are several types of higher powers, not all good. \n\nI think the knowledge was taught to lead a revolt and that revolt got shut down by another higher power.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an incomplete theory with some gaps but I do have sources that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be more than willing to share. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still studying what all the numbers and symbolism could mean, there is ALOT of hidden knowledge that we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t unlock unless we know the keys and symbolism of the time \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u00b7\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00bd\u00e2\u0080\u008d\u00e2\u0099\u0082\u00ef\u00b8\u008f",

Which is absolutely incredible if you know anything about astrology.\n\nThere is a thing called the procession of the equinoxes.\nTo complete a cycle of the procession, it takes 25,920 years.\n\nBasically 72 years is one degree in the procession, 360 degrees completes the procession.\n\nThe Mayans were seemingly able to predict exactly the time when the cycle would be in the center of the galaxy.
